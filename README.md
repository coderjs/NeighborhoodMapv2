# NeighborhoodMap

# Project Name: Neighborhood Map (Project for Udacity Front Developer Nanodegree)

 This app displays 25 restaurants in my NYC neighborbood of Murray Hill. 
 All venue information is sourced from Foursquare via their Venues API.
 In addition to the listings there is a search feature to filter the list.

## Credits
This was by far the most complicated project I have worked on to date. I referenced many sources in effort to complete this project, including: 
* Udacity course materials
* Udacity coaches and forums
* Udacity uConnect
* My coder friends and private tutors 
* Online resources (including: Google Maps API; Yelp API; Foursquare API; Stack Overflow; W3Schools; random Google searches, JSFiddle, etc)

## Licenses
I did acquire unique API keys for Google Maps, Foursquare, and Yelp for this project.
